# What content is applicable for the announcements channel

## Summary

What types of messages are relevant to the newly renamed announcements channel?

## Problem

Off the back of the Deep Work retro hosted by Chris, we had common consensus that #general too noisy.

To get round that we've created a new channel, #common-room for any chatter, and renamed general to announcements.

There is a lot of ambiguity about what content is suitable for the new channel.

## Proposal

All content in #announcements should be a notification/message that everyone should have visibility on.

In order to keep the channel "clean" any replies carried out in a thread.

Types of content for announcements;

- PRs for Handbook and RFCs
- Holiday requests
- WFH requests
- Sickness
- Lateness
- Tea/Coffee
