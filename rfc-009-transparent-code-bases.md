# Transparent Codebases

## Summary

Teams are expected to publish details on accessing their source code.

## Problem

It is currently difficult for teams to see what other teams are working on, and gain insights, provide feedback and generally for us as a company to learn from each other.

Even in the case where projects are hosted on madetech github, it's hard to filter through the large number of repositories.

## Proposal

Teams must publish, to a centralised location, links to details on how any Made Tech engineer can access their customer code.

In situations where NDAs preclude providing transparent access to codebases, there must be a document that outlines this and reasons why. 
If appropriate, teams should include steps that can be taken to gain access in these circumstances.
