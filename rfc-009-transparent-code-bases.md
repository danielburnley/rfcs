# Transparent Codebases

## Summary

Teams are expected to publish details on accessing their source code.

## Problem

It is currently difficult for teams to see what other teams are working on, and gain insights, provide feedback and generally for us as a company to learn from each other.

Even in the case where projects are hosted on madetech github, it's hard to filter through the large number of repositories.

## Proposal

Teams must publish, to a centralised location, links to details on how any Made Tech engineer can access their customer code.

In situations where NDAs preclude providing transparent access to codebases, there must be a document that outlines this and reasons why. 
If appropriate, teams should include steps that can be taken to gain access in these circumstances.

In situations where customers control the access to the version control systems, and may be unwilling to add the entire Made Tech team, we should use GitHub forking (or similar) feature to provide transparency to the Made Tech team.
