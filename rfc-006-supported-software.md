# Involve the Support Team in exotic software choices

## Summary

The support team must be involved in the decision making where major technology choices increase the burden on the support team.

## Problem

Currently the support team are expected to provide both BAU support, and offer improvements to any platforms that delivery teams ship.

## Proposal

Delivery teams should be empowered to embrace newer technologies where there is commercial justification.

The support team should expect to not be burdened with supporting unknown platforms without having input in to the decision making.

The support team publishes a list of software and platforms (to the granularity of "Python", "Elasticsearch", or "Cloud Foundry") that they currently have capability to support. Where teams wish to deviate from this, and where we need to provide ongoing support, teams MUST involve the support team in the decision making.
