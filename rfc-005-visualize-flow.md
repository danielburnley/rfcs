# Visualize Flow

## Summary

Work-in Process (WiP) should be kept to a minimum and all team members should be able to see sources of work, what is currently being worked on and what work is done.

## Problem

Teams not visualizing their work will find it hard to control WiP. 

Not controlling WiP will result in throughput issues.

## Proposal

All teams SHOULD visualize the flow of work on a Kanban-board.
