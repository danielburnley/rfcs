# Adopt TDD as a Team Norm

## Summary

Adopt the discipline of TDD (Test Driven Development) as a [team norm](https://github.com/madetech/handbook#team-norms).

## Problem

Ensuring a codebase has test coverage ensures that a codebase is evolvable and maintainable.

We want to ensure the software we write is flexible to the changing needs of our customers.

There is a general acceptance that TDD, or test first development, is a positive trait of a mature delivery team.
Currently, there is no explicit promise (a "team norm") that stipulates that we must practice Test Driven Development.

Also, we want to be explicit about the definition of TDD (and stand it apart from Test First Development).

## Proposal

Members of a Delivery Team MUST practice Test Driven Development, unless explicitly agreed by AT LEAST one other Made Tech Engineer. 

Agreements to not practice Test Driven Development MUST only be made in extenuating circumstances.

Test Driven Development is defined as a discipline with three rules:

1. You MUST write a failing test before you write any production code.
2. You MUST not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, or fail to compile.
3. You MUST not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass.
