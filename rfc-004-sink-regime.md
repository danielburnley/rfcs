# Keep the kitchen sink clear

## Summary

Keep our dirty crockery and cutlery from the sink such that the sink can be used all day.

## Problem

Currently we leave a lot of our dirty plates, bowls, and cutlery in the kitchen sink. During the day this mounts up and it becomes hard to use the sink for basic tasks such as running a glass of water.

## Proposal

Members of the team MUST thoroughly rinse their cutlery and crockery, before stacking it neatly in the drying rack. This keeps the sink free throughout the day, and ensures the office looks less like a student house.
